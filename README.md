# Volunteers Scheduler


## Description

This project was called Interview Scheduler before, but after  I customized the website base on the client requirments, I change the name to Volunteers Scheduler. The biggest change will be apply the volunteers in the selected time, it will show the page right away, and maximum two volunteers and three waitlist in the select time. I changed from the database, and move to back-end server, and lastly change the front-end.
